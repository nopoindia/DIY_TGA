NoPo developed an affordable Thermo Gravimetric Analyzer (TGA) using off-the-shelf components and open-source hardware. At under ₹15,000 (US$300), it matches the performance of ₹15,00,000 (US$30,000) instruments. Open-source designs are available, supported by VGST and built by interns from BMSCE and SVIT
